<p><strong>The Retimers & Redrivers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retimers</li><li>Redrivers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Retimers and Redrivers are market types related to signal integrity in high-speed data communication. Retimers are devices that receive, reshape, and retransmit signals to enhance transmission quality over long distances. They regenerate the signal to minimize signal degradation and provide longer reach. Redrivers, on the other hand, are simpler devices that improve signal quality by amplifying and equalizing the signals without full signal regeneration. They are typically used for shorter distances where signal degradation is less severe. Both Retimers and Redrivers help ensure reliable and robust data transmission in various applications like data centers, telecommunications, and high-speed interconnects.</p></p>
