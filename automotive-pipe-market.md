<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Welded</li><li>Seamless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive pipe market includes two main types: welded and seamless pipes. Welded pipes are manufactured by welding separate pieces of metal together, resulting in a joint along the pipe's length. They are cost-effective and commonly used in exhaust systems. On the other hand, seamless pipes are produced from a single piece of metal without any joints or welds. As a result, they offer higher strength and reliability, making them suitable for applications where leak resistance is essential, such as fuel lines or hydraulic systems.</p></p>
