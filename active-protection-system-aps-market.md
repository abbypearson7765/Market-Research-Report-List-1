<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Active Protection System (APS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard-kill</li><li>Soft-kill</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>An Active Protection System (APS) is a safety mechanism used to defend military vehicles and assets from incoming threats, such as missiles or rockets. There are two main types of APS markets: hard-kill and soft-kill. Hard-kill systems intercept and destroy the threat physically, using mechanisms like projectiles or explosive countermeasures. On the other hand, soft-kill systems use non-destructive methods like jamming or obscuring the threat's sensors, making it ineffective. Both types aim to neutralize threats and enhance the survivability of vehicles and assets in combat situations.</p></p>
