<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specular Microscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Specular Microscopes</li><li>Non-contact Specular Microscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Specular microscopes are used to examine the cornea's endothelial cell layer in the eye. Contact specular microscopes require direct contact with the cornea and use a special lens to capture images. Non-contact specular microscopes, on the other hand, do not require any physical contact and use a separate beam of light to capture images. Both types of microscopes are widely used in ophthalmology to assess the health of the cornea and diagnose various eye conditions.</p></p>
