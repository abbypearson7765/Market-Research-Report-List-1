<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Paint Spray Booth Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cross Flow Paint</li><li>Down Draft Paint</li><li>Side Down Draft Paint</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cross Flow Paint Spray Booth is a type of paint booth where air enters through one end of the booth and exits through the opposite end. This creates a horizontal airflow pattern that moves the overspray away from the painted object.</p><p>Down Draft Paint Spray Booth is a type of paint booth where fresh air is drawn from the ceiling and exits through the floor. This creates a vertical downward airflow that ensures that the overspray is captured and pulled down towards the floor.</p><p>Side Down Draft Paint Spray Booth is similar to the down draft booth, but the airflow pattern is directed sideways towards the walls. This helps in keeping the overspray away from the painted object, as it moves towards the walls for capture and exhaust.</p><p>Other types of paint spray booth may include semi-downdraft or modified downdraft booths, which combine elements of both the cross flow and down draft booths. These variations offer different airflow patterns and exhaust options depending on specific painting requirements.</p></p>
