<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Extruded Products Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mill-finished</li><li>Powder-coated</li><li>Anodized</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aluminum extruded products market can be categorized into three types based on the finishing process: mill-finished, powder-coated, and anodized. Mill-finished refers to the products that have undergone no additional finishing, thus retaining the raw appearance of the aluminum surface. Powder-coated products are coated with a dry powder that is then heated to form a protective and decorative layer. Anodized products go through an electrochemical process that adds a layer of oxide to the surface, enhancing durability, corrosion-resistance, and providing a wide range of colors and finishes.</p></p>
