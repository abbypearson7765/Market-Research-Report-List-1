<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) Systems for Submarines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fuel Cell AIP Systems</li><li>Stirling Engine AIP Systems</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Air-Independent Propulsion (AIP) Systems for submarines refer to technologies that allow submarines to operate for extended periods without the need to surface and access atmospheric oxygen. Fuel Cell AIP Systems use hydrogen stored on board in combination with oxygen from the surrounding seawater to produce electricity and power the submarine. Stirling Engine AIP Systems, on the other hand, use a closed-cycle engine that operates by heating and cooling a working fluid, which drives a piston and generates electricity. Both systems provide longer submerged endurance and increased stealth capabilities for submarines.</p></p>
