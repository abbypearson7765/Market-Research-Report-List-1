<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EG</li><li>CBH</li><li>BG</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Cellulase market types can be categorized into three main types: endo-glucanase (EG), cellobiohydrolase (CBH), and Î²-glucosidase (BG). EG enzymes are responsible for breaking down cellulose into smaller chain fragments. CBH enzymes continue the breakdown process by cleaving cellulose chains into cellobiose. BG enzymes further convert cellobiose into glucose, facilitating easier fermentation. These different types of cellulase enzymes play vital roles in biomass conversion, biofuel production, and in various industries where cellulose-based materials need to be broken down efficiently.</p></p>
