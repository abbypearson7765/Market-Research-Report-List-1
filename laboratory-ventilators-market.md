<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CMV</li><li>AMV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory ventilators are crucial equipment used in medical laboratories to provide mechanical ventilation support to patients in critical conditions. There are two main types of laboratory ventilators: Controlled Mechanical Ventilation (CMV) and Assisted Mechanical Ventilation (AMV). CMV refers to a ventilator mode where the machine takes full control of the patient's ventilation parameters, such as volume and pressure. On the other hand, AMV allows the patient to initiate breaths with the machine providing support when needed. Both types play significant roles in ensuring proper oxygenation and ventilation for patients.</p></p>
