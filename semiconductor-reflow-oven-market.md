<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Reflow Oven Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Convection Ovens</li><li>Vapour Phase Ovens</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Semiconductor Reflow Oven market includes two main types: Convection Ovens and Vapour Phase Ovens. Convection Ovens use a heating element to circulate hot air within the oven, ensuring even heat distribution. They are commonly used for lead-free soldering due to their capability of reaching high temperatures. On the other hand, Vapour Phase Ovens use a heat transfer medium, such as a boiling liquid, to transfer heat to the components. This method offers more precise temperature control and avoids overheating, making it suitable for delicate components.</p></p>
