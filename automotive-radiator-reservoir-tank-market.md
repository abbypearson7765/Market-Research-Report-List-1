<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Radiator Reservoir Tank Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressurized</li><li>Non-pressurized</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive radiator reservoir tank market consists of two types: pressurized and non-pressurized tanks. Pressurized tanks are designed to handle high pressure levels and are commonly used in vehicles with complex cooling systems. They ensure a constant supply of coolant to the radiator, even under high engine temperatures. On the other hand, non-pressurized tanks are used in simpler cooling systems, where the radiator draws coolant directly from the tank without any additional pressure. Both types serve the purpose of storing and supplying coolant to the radiator for efficient engine cooling.</p></p>
