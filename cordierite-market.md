<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cordierite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sintered Cordierite</li><li>Porous Cordierite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cordierite is a mineral commonly used in the automotive industry due to its excellent thermal stability. There are two main types of cordierite markets: sintered cordierite and porous cordierite. Sintered cordierite is produced by heat treating a mixture of cordierite and other materials, resulting in a dense and compact structure. This type of cordierite is preferred for applications requiring high mechanical strength. On the other hand, porous cordierite is manufactured by incorporating pore-forming agents, resulting in a high porosity material. Porous cordierite is used in applications that require good thermal shock resistance and low thermal expansion.</p></p>
