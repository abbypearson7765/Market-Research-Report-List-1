<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drive shaft and Propeller Shafts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Shaft</li><li>Hollow Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The drive shaft and propeller shafts market comprises two key types: rigid shafts and hollow shafts. Rigid shafts are solid and do not have any hollow space inside. They are commonly used in applications that require high torque transmission, ensuring smooth power transfer from the engine to the wheels or propellers. On the other hand, hollow shafts have an empty space inside, offering reduced weight and inertia. They are often used in various industries, including automotive and aerospace, where weight reduction is crucial for improved efficiency and performance.</p></p>
