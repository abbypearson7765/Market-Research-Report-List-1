<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flow Cytometric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coefficient of Variation<1%</li><li>Coefficient of Variation<3%</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Flow Cytometric market is classified into two types based on the Coefficient of Variation (CV) values. The first type is characterized by a CV value of less than 1%. This indicates that the measured values for each parameter are highly consistent and have minimal variation. The second type is characterized by a CV value of less than 3%. Although slightly higher, this still signifies a relatively low level of variation in the measured values. In both cases, low CV values indicate high precision and accuracy in flow cytometry measurements, making them highly desirable in research and diagnostic applications.</p></p>
