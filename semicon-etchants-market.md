<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semicon Etchants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>WetEtchingAgents</li><li>DryEtchingAgents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The semicon etchants market includes two main types: wet etching agents and dry etching agents. Wet etching agents are liquid chemicals used to remove unwanted materials from semiconductors by dissolving them. This process is commonly used to create patterns and structures in semiconductors. On the other hand, dry etching agents use plasma or gas to remove unwanted materials through chemical or physical reactions. This method is more precise, allowing for smaller and more complex structures to be created. Both types play significant roles in the fabrication of semiconductors.</p></p>
