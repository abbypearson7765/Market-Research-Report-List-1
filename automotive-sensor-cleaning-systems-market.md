<p><strong>The Automotive Sensor Cleaning Systems Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Based System</li><li>Gas Based System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Automotive sensor cleaning systems have two main types: liquid-based systems and gas-based systems. Liquid-based systems use a liquid solution to clean the sensors, which is sprayed onto the sensors to remove dust and debris. Gas-based systems, on the other hand, use a gas, such as nitrogen, to clean the sensors. This gas is released in a controlled manner to blow away any particles from the sensors. Both types of systems are used in the automotive industry to ensure accurate functioning of sensors, enhancing vehicle safety and performance.</p></p>
