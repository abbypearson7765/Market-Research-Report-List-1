<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Firestop Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomeric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The flexible firestop sealant market encompasses two main types: elastomeric type and intumescent type. Elastomeric type sealants are typically made of flexible materials such as silicone or polyurethane, allowing for easy application and accommodating movements in structures. They form a seal to prevent the spread of fire and smoke. Intumescent type sealants, on the other hand, rely on a chemical reaction when exposed to heat, expanding and forming a heat-insulating layer to protect against fire. Both types play an essential role in fire safety by preventing the spread of fire in buildings and structures.</p></p>
