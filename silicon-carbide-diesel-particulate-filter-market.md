<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silicon Carbide Diesel Particulate Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Pssive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the context of the Silicon Carbide Diesel Particulate Filter market, Active filters refer to the filters equipped with an active regeneration system, which helps to burn off accumulated particulate matter more efficiently. Passive filters, on the other hand, do not have an active regeneration system and rely on the exhaust temperature to trigger the natural regeneration process, gradually burning off the particulate matter. These two types of filters offer different methods of particulate matter removal and regeneration, catering to various needs and preferences in the market.</p></p>
