<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Ventilators for Critical Care Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical ventilators for critical care are devices used to assist patients with breathing difficulties. There are two types of market for these devices: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators are used for patients who cannot breathe adequately on their own and require intubation, where a tube is inserted into their airway. These ventilators deliver oxygen directly into the patient's lungs. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver oxygen through a mask or other interface, without the need for intubation, and are commonly used for patients with less severe breathing difficulties.</p></p>
