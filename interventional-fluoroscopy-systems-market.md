<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interventional Fluoroscopy Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With C-arm</li><li>With Table</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Interventional fluoroscopy systems market consists of two main types of systems: with C-arm and with table. With C-arm systems, fluoroscopy is performed using a mobile C-shaped arm that can be easily maneuvered around the patient. This allows for flexibility in positioning the system for different procedures. On the other hand, with table systems, fluoroscopy is performed using a fixed table where the patient lies down. These systems are designed to provide stability during complex procedures and offer precise positioning capabilities. Both types of systems are used in interventional radiology procedures for real-time imaging guidance.</p></p>
