<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil Sump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Structural</li><li>Non-Structural</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The oil sump market can be categorized into two types: structural and non-structural. Structural oil sumps refer to those designed as an integral part of the engine structure, providing stability and support. They are typically made of robust materials and are essential for the engine's operation. On the other hand, non-structural oil sumps are separate components attached to the engine and mainly serve the purpose of collecting oil. While non-structural sumps are not directly involved in the engine's structural integrity, they play a crucial role in maintaining adequate lubrication.</p></p>
