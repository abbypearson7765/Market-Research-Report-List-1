<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Forging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Forging</li><li>Warm Forging</li><li>Cold Forging</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Industrial forging is a manufacturing process used to shape metal materials. The market includes three types: hot forging, warm forging, and cold forging. Hot forging involves heating the metal above its recrystallization temperature to make it more malleable. Warm forging involves working the metal at temperatures slightly below its recrystallization temperature. Cold forging, on the other hand, is done at room temperature and requires high pressure to shape the metal. These different forging methods are utilized based on the specific requirements of the final product and the desired strength and properties of the metal.</p></p>
