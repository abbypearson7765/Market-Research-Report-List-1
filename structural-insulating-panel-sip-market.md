<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Insulating Panel (SIP) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EPS</li><li>XPS</li><li>PUR</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Structural Insulating Panels (SIPs) are construction materials made of foam insulation sandwiched between two structural panels, enhancing the building's insulation and strength. There are three dominant types of SIPs based on the foam insulation material used: Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), Extruded Polystyrene (XPS), and Polyurethane (PUR). EPS panels are cost-effective and have good insulation properties but are less resistant to moisture. XPS panels offer increased moisture resistance but are slightly more expensive. PUR panels provide the highest insulation value and excellent moisture resistance but are the most expensive option.</p></p>
