<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oral X Ray Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog X-Ray</li><li>Digital X-Ray</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Oral X-ray Machines Market consists of two main types: Analog X-Ray and Digital X-Ray. Analog X-ray machines use traditional film and require manual processing, while digital X-ray machines use digital sensors that capture images directly and transmit them to a computer for processing. Analog machines have been used for a long time and are cost-effective but require more time and space for processing. On the other hand, digital machines are faster, provide high-quality images, and allow for easy storage and sharing of the X-ray results.</p></p>
