<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scraper Heat Exchangers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reciprocating Type</li><li>Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Scraper heat exchangers are classified into two market types: reciprocating type and rotating type. The reciprocating type is designed with stationary plates that reciprocate back and forth to scrape off the fouling deposits on the heat transfer surface. This type of exchanger is suitable for applications where frequent cleaning is required. On the other hand, the rotating type consists of a rotating assembly that utilizes blades or scrapers to remove fouling deposits from the heat transfer surface. This type is commonly used in applications with high fouling tendencies and where continuous operation is important.</p></p>
