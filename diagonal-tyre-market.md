<p><h1>Diagonal Tyre Market Research Report: The Key To Successful Business Strategy Forecasted for Period from 2023 - 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>A diagonal tyre, also known as a bias-ply tyre, is a type of tire construction where the cords inside the tire run diagonally across from one bead to the other. This design provides overall strength and durability but comes with certain trade-offs such as less traction and a rougher ride. Diagonal tyres were once the dominant type of tire construction, but with advancements in technology, radial tyres have become more popular in recent years.</p><p>Looking at the current and future outlook of the diagonal tyre market, it is important to consider the shift in consumer preferences towards radial tyres. Radial tyres offer improved fuel efficiency, better handling, and a smoother ride compared to diagonal tyres. As a result, the demand for diagonal tyres has been on the decline.</p><p>However, there are still certain applications where diagonal tyres have an advantage. These tyres are often used in off-road vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, and certain agricultural and industrial vehicles where their robust construction and lower cost make them a more viable option. Additionally, in some developing regions where cost is a major factor, diagonal tyres continue to be preferred due to their affordability.</p><p>Considering these factors, the diagonal tyre market is expected to experience a moderate growth rate. Despite the declining overall demand, specific applications and regions will continue to drive the market. It is projected that the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.2% during the forecasted period. Manufacturers in this market will need to focus on research and development to improve the performance of diagonal tyres and meet the changing demands of consumers.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diagonal Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Common Diagonal Tyre</li><li>Bias Belted Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The diagonal tyre market consists of two main types: common diagonal tyres and bias belted tyres. Common diagonal tyres are made by layering cords at 45-degree angles across the width of the tyre, providing flexibility and strength. They are typically used in heavy-duty vehicles for off-road purposes. On the other hand, bias belted tyres have an additional layer of belts made of steel or fabric. This layer runs diagonally from bead to bead, offering better stability and performance on smooth surfaces. Bias belted tyres are commonly found in motorcycles, scooters, and some light trucks.</p></p>
