<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace Industry Torque Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Torques Sensors</li><li>Non-Contacting Torque Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aerospace industry torque sensor market consists of two main types: rotary torque sensors and non-contacting torque sensors. Rotary torque sensors measure torque by utilizing a mechanical linkage or strain gauge technology. They are commonly used in applications where continuous torque monitoring is required. On the other hand, non-contacting torque sensors use technologies like magnetoelastic, magnetostrictive, or surface acoustic wave to measure torque without any mechanical contact. These sensors are ideal for high-speed or high-precision applications where the presence of mechanical components could interfere with the measurement accuracy.</p></p>
