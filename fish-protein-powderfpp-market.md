<p><strong>The Fish Protein PowderFPP Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fish Protein Concentrate (FPC)</li><li>Fish Protein Isolate (FPI)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fish protein powder (FPP) market is categorized into two types: fish protein concentrate (FPC) and fish protein isolate (FPI). FPC is made by extracting protein from fish through processes like hydrolysis, which results in a concentrated protein powder. FPC contains a moderate amount of protein along with other nutrients. On the other hand, FPI is a more refined form of FPC, where the protein content is higher as it goes through additional purification steps. Both FPC and FPI serve as valuable sources of protein in various food and dietary supplement applications.</p></p>
