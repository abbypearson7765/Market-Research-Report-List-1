<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Allyl Alcohol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allyl Acetate Hydrolysis Method</li><li>PO Isomerization Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Allyl alcohol is produced through two main methods: Allyl acetate hydrolysis and PO isomerization. In the hydrolysis method, allyl acetate is reacted with water to yield allyl alcohol. This process offers high purity but is more expensive. On the other hand, the isomerization method involves the conversion of propylene oxide (PO) into allyl alcohol. This method is cost-effective but results in lower purity. Both methods are used in the allyl alcohol market, with the choice depending on factors such as cost, purity requirements, and availability of raw materials.</p></p>
