<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sealed Maintenance Free (SMF) Batteries Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbed Glass Mat Battery</li><li>Gel Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sealed Maintenance Free (SMF) Batteries are a type of battery that does not require any maintenance or refilling of electrolyte fluids. There are two main types of SMF batteries: Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) Battery and Gel Battery. AGM batteries use a fiberglass mat to absorb and hold the electrolyte, providing a higher power density and greater resistance to vibrations. Gel batteries, on the other hand, use a gel-like substance as the electrolyte, which improves their ability to withstand deep cycling and overcharging. Both types of SMF batteries are commonly used in various applications, including automotive and renewable energy systems.</p></p>
